# Maze-and-search

## Launch:
- First argument: the path to the maze.txt file or a similar one, maze_generator creates this type of file.
- Second argument: type of the algorithm (DFS, BFS, GBFS, AStar).
- Third argument: showing the explored nodes (show).
- The graphical representation of the algorithm's operation uses the pillow module (pip install pillow).


### Maze generation:
A depth-first search generation algorithm is used: we navigate the maze until we hit a wall or an already existing passage, then we try to turn in other available directions. If none are available, we return to the previous vertex and repeat the described actions for it. Thus, we traverse all possible paths, bounded by walls one unit thick. The algorithm generates a maze with only one path to the endpoint. We always move in steps of two to leave walls between the paths. **Support for launch** arguments is added â€” maze dimensions (width height).

**DFS:** A depth-first search (DFS) uses a stack in the frontier, allowing us to explore each path to its end before backtracking to the last turn.

**BFS:** In the second case, the frontier is a queue, and we explore each path uniformly, taking all turns sequentially (BFS).

**GBFS:** In this algorithm, we have created a heuristic that chooses the closest way to the finish using the *Manhattan distance*. A node will be explored only if it's not further to the finish than the other one.

**AStar:** Here we also count how many steps it took to get to this node from the start. We will explore that node which has the smallest sum of its Manhattan and travel distances.

###### Additional information: 
1. BFS and AStar will guaranteed find the optimal way, while DFS and GBFS will not.
1. Sometimes DFS and GBFS can find the way faster due to their aggressive strategy.
1. In the case of specific "DFS" maze generation, the DFS algorithm is optimal and can usually be more effective.
